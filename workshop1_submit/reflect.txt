I have learned how to use and work with multiple files (adding the items and header files) as a single project. It was my first time using GitHub and actually pushing it through Matrix. I have worked with the matrix before, but I never used to actually implement my project there. The testing part where we have to verify each function individually was also something new to learn. When it comes to difficulties, I would start with the fact that I am learning the basics of C++, as I have never coded with that programming language. I came across lots of issues regarding reading files, as they are all connected, and it took me hours to figure out what to do and where the errors came from. The first run's output was slightly different from the expected one, and the code submission was aborted. My suggestion would be maybe including the alternative options to submit the files from your laptop to the school one. Last but not least, maybe make fewer restrictions so even if there is a little caps lock error, the system still accepts the code, because students are not always able to make the code perfect, so it would be nice to have the possibility to submit whatever you have done and was able to compile successfully.
